##Inspiration
A project for the LHD: Build hackathon

##What it does
encrypts and decrypts a hash using the cryptography module in python

##How we built it
I used the cryptography module in python to do this.

##Challenges we ran into
Not able to use our own key, but use the generator.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
The project as a whole

##What we learned
a lot about hashing, keys and salting
